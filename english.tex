\def\WhatIsDebianCaption{What is Debian GNU/Linux?}

\def\WhatIsDebian{
%
Debian is a free operating system for your computer.  Debian is currently
based on the Linux kernel and includes more than 59,000 packages of
utilities and applications.  This is far more software than is available for any other
Free operating system. Ten architectures and variants are supported, including
32-bit and 64-bit PCs.
Since 1993, volunteer developers (currently more than 1,000) are working on
maintaining Debian's high quality.
%
}

\def\FreedomCaption{Freedom}

\def\Freedom{
%
As stated in the Debian Social Contract, Debian is comprised entirely of
Free Software.  By Free Software, we
don't just mean zero cost, but also the Freedom to use it how and where you
want, share it with your friends, read and modify the source code, and
distribute those changes to other people.
%
}

\def\ContinuityCaption{Continuity}

\def\Continuity{
%
The Debian packaging system permits a seamless transition to newer
program versions without the requirement to begin a new installation
from scratch, and it won't delete your old configuration files.
Dependencies between programs are handled automatically:
if a package which you want to install
requires another package, the installer takes care of it.
You can install and upgrade using BluRay discs, DVDs, CDROMs, USB sticks,
or using a network connection, whatever suits you best.
%
}

\def\SecurityCaption{Security}

\def\Security{
%
Debian is secure by default, and easily adjustable in case of really extreme
security demands.  It is easy to install a Debian system with just very little
software.  When a security problem is found, the Debian Security Team releases
packages with backported security fixes, generally within 48 hours.  With the
help of the Debian package management system, it is therefore easy even for an
inexperienced administrator to keep up to date with security.  This service is
available to anyone for free.
%
}

\def\QualityCaption{Quality}

\def\Quality{
%
Thanks to the personal commitment of Debian developers, package quality is
unequalled.  Keeping this standard up is furthermore helped by the Debian
Policy Manual, which describes exactly how packages should behave and interact
with the system.  A package which violates the policy will not be included in
the official stable Debian release.  Another aid in quality assurance is the
open Debian bug tracking system.  Debian does not hide problems.
Debian has no
commercial pressure and will not release a new and
possibly unstable version just because the market requires it.

}

\def\IncludedCaption{Included with Debian GNU/Linux}

\def\Included{
%
The complete Debian GNU/Linux distribution consists of at least 12
DVDs, 74 CDs or 3 BDs.  These discs hold just the architecture-dependent
