# git salsa.debian.org:debian/debian-flyers.git

- review english.tex; use e.g. a blurb from sponsorship flyer as published by
  debconf organisers to explain what debian is about.  do not assume reader
  knows what an 'operating system' or what 'source code' is.

- ask for translation updates.

- document how to upload content in ./pages.debian.net to the right webserver.

- Makefile: do not call 'latex' but 'latexmk -pdf' (Package: latexmk) to
  generate pdf's.  don't generate pure .ps anymore.  thanks ansgar and _jwilk @
  #debian-til irc.oftc.net 12 okt 2018 for comments: "let's not create impression
  that PS is a format that should be used these days".  The state of
  GhostScript--the only PostScript interpreter in Debian--is bad, security-wise.

- Review copyrights in translations.

- Add more translations.
