- get dansk.tex, italiano.tex, portugues.tex, svenska.tex updated
- the "translation-check" mechanism probably uses the english.tex CVS Id
  from the former CVS at Joey's host.  Document the mechanism, and make it
  work with current CVS.  A "check" make-target would be nice.
- get http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debian-flyers/ linked to from
  http://www.nl.debian.org/events/material#flyers (a link
  to Jaldhar H. Vyas's DocBook XML leaflet on
  http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debianintro/ would be nice too.)
- merge with the 2004-06-14 stuff on http://people.debian.org/~mbanck/flyer/
  (if not already done)
